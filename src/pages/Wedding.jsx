          this year. I was so inspired by the mission and culture of Posit that
          I was exposed to back in 2022, and those sentiments were only
          reaffirmed and made stronger during my last trip to the conference a
          few months ago. I have been waiting for the right moment to seek a new
          opportunity from my current job, and I believe that I am now at a
          place where I can start exploring, and I couldnâ€™t be more excited to
          apply for a position at Posit. During my time at PNC, I have
          established myself as an advanced R Shiny web developer. I have
          successfully developed and implemented numerous applications that have
          significantly enhanced data analysis and reporting capabilities within
          the organization. I have collaborated closely with stakeholders to
          understand their requirements, design intuitive interfaces, and
          deliver user-friendly solutions that empower data-driven decision
          making. However, I started to want more. I wanted to expand my already
          solid knowledge of web development through Shiny, and use it to learn
          more widely used frameworks, such as React. With this inspiration, I
          took a six-month long project-based
