      "When you RSVP, we will ask you to provide a good email address that you regularly check. Since the event is so far out, there are details we don't quite have just yet (i.e name of dinner places, transporation info etc). We will be sending out communications via email when information on the site has been updated, so you may check it. It shouldn't be more than a couple of communications.",
